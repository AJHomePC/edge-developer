# Progressive Web Apps overview  

## What's a PWA  

**[Progressive Web Apps][MDNApps]** \(PWAs\) provide access to open web technologies for cross-platform interoperability and provide your users with a native, app-like experience customized for their devices. 

PWAs are websites that are **[progressively enhanced][AListApartUnderstandingProgressiveEnhancement]** to function like native apps on supporting platforms, and like regular web sites on other browsers.  

The qualities of a PWA combine **the best of the web and native apps**. PWAs run in browsers, like websites, but have access to native app features like the ability to work offline, be installed as a native app, support push notifications and periodic updates, access hardware features, and more.  

**PWAs are first-class citizens on Windows**. When installed, they behave like other apps. They can be added to the start menu, pinned to the task bar, handle files, run on user login, and more.  

PWAs can also be **submitted to the Microsoft Store** where millions of Windows users can discover and easily install them alongside other Windows apps.

*   Trivago saw an increase of 150% for people who add its PWA to the home screen and the increased engagement led to a 97% increase in clickouts to hotel offers ([source][TrivagoSuccessStory]).
