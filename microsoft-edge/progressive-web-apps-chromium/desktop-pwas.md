# Why build a PWA on desktop  

Using Web technologies to write your desktop app as a PWA comes with many advantages.

First, as described in the [Progressive Web Apps on Windows overview](./index.md), PWAs are:  

*  Easier to discover and install.  
*  Linkable.  
*  Safe to run.  
*  Responsive.  
*  Work offline.  

On top of this, PWAs on desktop also come with a unique set of advantages:  

*  Shared codebase between your website, mobile app and desktop app (across operating systems).  
*  Your app can be published on the Microsoft Store, making it more familiar and trustworthy for Windows users to discover and install.  

## PWAs are not just for mobile  

PWAs are not only a way for websites to appear on mobile home screens, they are based on standard, cross-browser, web technologies that allow them to be installed and to run everywhere.  
While most consumers have migrated to mobile-first (or mobile-only) ways of consuming content, businesses still mostly operate only on desktop.  
Building your desktop app as a PWA allows you make use of all the benefits that PWAs come with while targeting those users.  

With many new web capabilities as well as new features of Microsoft Edge and Windows, there are great opportunities to build immersive experiences that deeply integrate with the desktop operating system, and look and feel native, while sticking to technologies that will work in other browsers, operating systems and devices.  

Depending on your requirements, you might not have to build your app with native technologies at all as the web has grown capabilities to easily deal with file systems, video and audio, high-performing code, databases, USB, bluetooth, and more.  

## Simple install experience and OS integration

What does it look like on Microsoft Edge to find and install an app.
What does it look like once installed on Windows (icon, shortcut, start menu, task bar).
Specific integration features (shortcuts, notifications, file handling, ...)

## The Microsoft Store

Pitch about why this is great for distributing PWAs.

Discoverability (people naturally look there), Trustworthiness, Easy install, App analytics thanks to the store.
The Microsoft Store is now one of the most used apps on PCs

## Web capabilities

A few examples of impressive APIs that compete with native, that people might not have thought about.

* Push notifications
* Media: access to bluethooth, USB
* Intensive WebGL content
* Native performance with WebAssembly
