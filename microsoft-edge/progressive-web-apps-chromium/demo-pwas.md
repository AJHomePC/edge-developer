[App](https://captainbrosset.github.io/mytracks/), [source code and Readme file](https://github.com/captainbrosset/mytracks).

### What the app does

This app shows a map and gives users the ability to import GPS track data (from GPX files). Tracks can be imported by either opening a GPX file from the OS, or by using the "import" button at the top.

Tracks are displayed in a list on the side and can be toggled on the map.

Tracks can also be exported as GPX files again, or deleted.

The color of each track can be changed independently.

Tracks are only stored locally (using IndexedDB).
