# Use Service Workers to manage network requests

Service Workers are a special type of [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) with the ability to intercept, modify, and respond to network requests using the `Fetch` API.  Service Workers can access the `Cache` API, and asynchronous client-side data stores, such as `IndexedDB`, to store resources.

Service Workers can make your PWA faster by caching resources locally and they can also make your PWA more reliable by making it network-independent.

The first time a user accesses your PWA, its Service Worker is installed. The Service Worker then runs in parallel to your app, and can continue doing work even when your app is not running.

Service Workers are mostly responsible for intercepting, modifying, and responding to network requests They can be alerted when the app tries to load a resource from the server, or sends a request to get data from the server. When this happens, a Service Worker can decide to let the request go to the server, or intercept it and return a response from the cache instead.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Register a Service Worker

Similar to other Web Workers, Service Workers must exist in a separate file. You reference this file when registering the Service Worker, as shown in the following code:

```javascript
if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register( "/serviceworker.js");
}
```

The web browser that's running your PWA may provide different levels of support for Service Workers. Additionally, the context in which your PWA is running may not be secure. As such, it's a good practice to test for the existence of the `navigator.serviceWorker` object before running any Service Worker-related code. In the above code, a Service Worker is registered using the `serviceworker.js` file located at the root of the site.

Make sure to place the Service Worker file in the highest-level directory that you want it to manage.  Such a directory is called the _scope_ of the Service Worker.  In the previous code, the file is stored in the root directory of your app, and the Service Worker manages all pages under the app's domain name.

If the Service Worker file was stored in a `js` directory, the scope of the Service Worker would be limited to the `js` directory and any subdirectories.  As a best practice, place the Service Worker file in the root of your app, unless you need to reduce the scope of your Service Worker.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Intercept requests

The main event that you use in a Service Worker is the `fetch` event. The `fetch` event runs every time the browser your app runs in attempts to access content within the scope of the Service Worker.

The following code shows how to add a listener to the fetch event:

```javascript
self.addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  console.log('WORKER: Fetching', event.request);
});
```

Within the `fetch` handler, you can control whether a request goes to the network, pulls from the cache, and so on.  The approach you take will likely vary, based on the type of resource being requested, how frequently it is updated, and other business logic that's unique to your application.

Here are a few examples of what you can do within the `fetch` handler:

*   If available, return a response from the cache; otherwise, fallback to requesting the resource over the network.
*   Fetch a resource from the network, cache a copy, and return the response.
*   Allow users to specify a preference to save data.
*   Supply a placeholder image for certain image requests.
*   Generate a response directly in the Service Worker.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## The Service Worker lifecycle

The lifecycle of a Service Worker consists of multiple steps, with each step triggering an event. You can add listeners to these events to run code to perform an action. The following list presents a high-level view of the lifecycle and related events of Service Workers.

1.  Register the Service Worker.

1.  The browser downloads the JavaScript file, installs the Service Worker, and triggers the `install` event. You can use the `install` event to pre-cache any important and long-lived files, such as CSS files, JavaScript files, logo images, offline pages, and so on from your website.

    ```javascript
    self.addEventListener("install", event => {
        console.log("WORKER: install event in progress.");
    });
    ```

1.  The Service Worker is activated, which triggers the `activate` event.  Use this event to clean up outdated caches.

    ```javascript
    self.addEventListener("activate", event => {
        console.log("WORKER: activate event in progress.");
    });
    ```

1.  The Service Worker is ready to run when the page is refreshed or when the user goes to a new page on the site. If you want to run the Service Worker without waiting, use the `self.skipWaiting()` method during the `install` event, as follows:

    ```javascript
    self.addEventListener("install", event => {
        self.skipWaiting();
        // â€¦
    });
    ```

1.  The Service Worker is now running and can listen to `fetch` events.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Pre-cache resources

When a user accesses your app for the first time, the app's Service Worker is installed. Use the `install` event in your Service Worker to detect when this occurs, and cache all the static resources your app needs. Caching your app's static resources, such as the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code needed by the start page, makes it possible to run your app even when the user's device is offline.

To cache your app's resources, use the global `caches` object and the `cache.addAll` method as shown below:

```javascript
// The name of the cache your app uses.
const CACHE_NAME = "my-app-cache";
// The list of static files your app needs to start.
const PRE_CACHED_RESOURCES = ["/", "styles.css", "app.js"];

// Listen to the `install` event.
self.addEventListener("install", event => {
  async function preCacheResources() {
    // Open the app's cache.
    const cache = await caches.open(CACHE_NAME);
    // Cache all static resources.
    cache.addAll(PRE_CACHED_RESOURCES);
  }

  event.waitUntil(preCacheResources());
});
```

Note that after the initial installation, the `install` event does not run again. To update your Service Worker's code, see [Update your Service Worker](#update-your-service-worker).

Now use the `fetch` event to return the static resources from the cache instead of loading them again from the network:

```javascript
self.addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  async function returnCachedResource() {
    // Open the app's cache.
    const cache = await caches.open(CACHE_NAME);
    // Find the response that was pre-cached during the `install` event.
    const cachedResponse = await cache.match(event.request.url);

    if (cachedResponse) {
      // Return the resource.
      return cachedResponse;
    } else {
      // If the resource was not found in the cache. Try the network.
      const fetchResponse = await fetch(event.request.url);
      // Put the response in cache.
      cache.put(event.request.url, fetchResponse.clone());
      // And return the response.
      return fetchResponse.
    }
  }

  event.respondWith(returnCachedResource());
});
```

For brevity, the above code example does not handle the cases where getting the request URL from the network failed.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Use a custom offline page

When your app uses multiple HTML pages, a common offline scenario is to redirect page navigation requests to a custom error page when the user's device is offline:

```javascript
// The name of the cache your app uses.
const CACHE_NAME = "my-app-cache";
// The list of static files your app needs to start.
// Note the offline.html page in this list.
const PRE_CACHED_RESOURCES = ["/", "styles.css", "app.js", "offline.html"];

// Listen to the `install` event.
self.addEventListener("install", event => {
  async function preCacheResources() {
    // Open the app's cache.
    const cache = await caches.open(CACHE_NAME);
    // Cache all static resources.
    cache.addAll(PRE_CACHED_RESOURCES);
  }

  event.waitUntil(preCacheResources());
});

self.addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  async function navigateOrDisplayOfflinePage() {
    try {
      // Try to load the page from the network.
      const networkResponse = await fetch(event.request);
      return networkResponse;
    } catch (error) {
      // The network call failed, the device is offline.
      const cache = await caches.open(CACHE_NAME);
      const cachedResponse = await cache.match("offline.html");
      return cachedResponse;
    }
  }

  // We only want to call event.respondWith() if this is a navigation request
  // for an HTML page.
  if (event.request.mode === 'navigate') {
    event.respondWith(navigateOrDisplayOfflinePage());
  }
});
```

## Update your Service Worker

#### Install a new Service Worker version

If you make changes to your Service Worker code and deploy the new Service Worker file to your web server, your users' devices will start using the new Service Worker gradually.

Every time a user navigates to one of your app's pages, the browser that's running the app checks if a new version of the Service Worker is available on the server. The browser detects new versions by comparing the contents between the existing Service Worker and the new Service Worker. When a change is detected, the new Service Worker is installed (its `install` event is triggered) and then waits for the existing Service Worker to stop being used on the device.

In practice, this means that there can be two Service Workers running at the same time, but only one intercepts the app's network requests. When the app is closed, the existing Service Worker stops being used. The next time the app is opened, the new Service Worker is activated. The `activate` event is triggered, and the new Service Worker starts intercepting `fetch` events.

You can forcefully activate the new Service Worker as soon as it's installed by using `self.skipWaiting()` in your Service Worker's `install` event handler.

To learn more about how Service Workers update, see [Updating the service worker](https://web.dev/service-worker-lifecycle#updates) on web.dev.

#### Update your cached static files

When pre-caching static resources such as CSS stylesheet files, as described in [Pre-cache resources](#pre-cache-resources), your app only uses the cached versions of the files and doesn't try to download new versions.

To make sure users get the latest changes to the static resources used by your app, use a cache busting naming convention and update your Service Worker code.

Cache-busting means that each static file is named according to its version. This can be achieved in various ways by usually involves using a build tool that reads the content of a file and generates a unique ID based on the content which can be used to name the file. 

Next, update your Service Worker code to cache the new static resources on `install`:

```javascript
// The name of the new cache your app uses.
const CACHE_NAME = "my-app-cache-v2";
// The list of static files your app needs to start.
const PRE_CACHED_RESOURCES = ["/", "styles-124656.css", "app-576391.js"];

// Listen to the `install` event.
self.addEventListener("install", event => {
  async function preCacheResources() {
    // Open the app's cache.
    const cache = await caches.open(CACHE_NAME);
    // Cache the new static resources.
    cache.addAll(PRE_CACHED_RESOURCES);
  }

  event.waitUntil(preCacheResources());
});

// Listen to the `activate` event to clear old caches.
self.addEventListener("activate", event => {
  async function deleteOldCaches() {
    // List all caches by their names.
    const names = await caches.keys();
    await Promise.all(names.map(name => {
      if (name !== CACHE_NAME) {
        // If a cache's name is the current name, delete it.
        return caches.delete(name);
      }
    }));
  }

  event.waitUntil(deleteOldCaches());
});
```

Compare the `CACHE_NAME` and `PRE_CACHED_RESOURCES` values between the above code snippet and the one in [Pre-cache resources](#pre-cache-resources). When this new Service Worker is installed, a new cache will be created and the new static resources will be downloaded and cached. When the Service Worker is activated, the old cache will be deleted. At this point, the user will have the new version of the app.

Making changes to your Service Worker can sometimes be complex. Use a library such as [Workbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/) to simplify your static resources build step and Service Worker code.

## Other capabilities

#### Period background ...

#### Push Notifications

Service Workers can push notifications to users.  Push notifications can prompt users to re-engage with your application after time has elapsed.  To learn more, see [Re-engage users with badges, notifications, and push messages](notifications-badges.md).
