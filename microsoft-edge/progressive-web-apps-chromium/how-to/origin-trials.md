# Experimental features and origin trials  

Some of the PWA features in Microsoft Edge are still experimental. Experimental features can be used in 2 ways:   

*   By enabling the corresponding flag in Microsoft Edge.
*   By enrolling your site in an origin trial to test features in production with your users.  

## Toggle experimental features  

To turn on \(or off\) experimental features in Microsoft Edge, complete the following steps.  
  
1.  Open Microsoft Edge.  
1.  Navigate to `edge://flags`.  
1.  Navigate to the relevant experiment.  
1.  Select the dropdown menu next to the experiment description and select **Enabled** to enable the feature or **Disabled** to disable it.

## Enroll your site in an origin trial  

Microsoft Edge sometimes uses origin trials to test features for specific domains or websites.  

If you're a website owner, you can use an origin trial for your website to apply a specific feature in production. An origin trial provides features to a percentage of Microsoft Edge users who visit your website.  

For more information about Origin Trials, navigate to [Microsoft Edge Origin Trials Developer Console][MicrosoftDeveloperMicrosoftEdgeOriginTrials].
