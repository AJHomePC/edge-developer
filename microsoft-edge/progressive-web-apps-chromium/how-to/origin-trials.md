# Origin trials  

Microsoft Edge sometimes uses origin trials to test features for specific domains or websites.  

If you're a website owner, you can use an origin trial for your website to apply a specific feature in production. An origin trial provides features to a percentage of Microsoft Edge users who visit your website.  

For more information about Origin Trials, navigate to [Microsoft Edge Origin Trials Developer Console][MicrosoftDeveloperMicrosoftEdgeOriginTrials].
