# Network request blocking

The **Network request blocking** tool is also called the **Network request blocking** panel or the **Network request blocking** tab.

TBD.  The UI contains the following items:

the **Enable network request blocking** checkbox

the **Add pattern** (`+`) icon/button

the **Remove all patterns** (strikethrough circle) icon/button

The initial message displayed is "Network requests are not blocked."

1. Select the **Add pattern** button.  The message appears, "Text pattern to block matching requests; use * for wildcard".

The initial message is "Pattern input cannot be empty."

1. Select the **Add** button.  Or, select the **Cancel** button.  The pattern you entered is added to the list of patterns, with a checkbox that's selected.
