# Sample code for DevTools

The [MicrosoftEdge/Demos](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos) repo contains most of the demo pages or sample code that's used by the documentation.

The [MicrosoftEdge/DevToolsSamples](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/DevToolsSamples) repo contains several demos that are used by the documentation, including for **3D View**, **Inspect tool**, **Console**, and accessibility testing.

The rendered demo pages below are useful for exploring tools such as **Elements** and **Sources**.<!-- & creating screenshots -->
