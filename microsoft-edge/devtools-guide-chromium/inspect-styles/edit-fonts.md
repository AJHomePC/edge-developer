# Editing CSS font settings in the styles pane (experimental) 

Typography on the web is an important part of the user experience. CSS has evolved in this space a lot in the recent years. The biggest trick is to make sure you allow for flexibility. You want to ensure that text is readable and can be zoomed and you shouldn't rely on certain fonts to be available but instead use fallback options to display when your favorite font isn't available.

CSS allows you to define fonts as font families and there are dozens of different CSS units available to define the size of text. You also have several CSS properties that affect font-size, spacing, line height and other typographic features. This can become hard to grasp which is why there is now a font editor in the styles pane.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently this is an [experimental feature](DevtoolsExperiments) and you need to enable it for developer tools. 

Any CSS section of the styles pane that has font definitions and the inline styles section shows a font icon that allows you to open the font editor. 

:::image type="complex" source="../media/font-editor-icon.msft.png" alt-text="The icon in the styles pane indicating that you can edit font settings" lightbox="../media/font-editor-icon.msft.png":::
