# WebAudio

The Web Audio API provides a way to control audio on the Web, allowing you to:
* Select audio sources.
* Add effects.
* Create audio visualizations.
* Apply spatial effects, such as panning.

The **WebAudio** tool is also called the **WebAudio** panel or the **WebAudio** tab.

This panel initially shows a trash can icon near "(no recordings)", and the message "Open a page that uses WebAudio to start monitoring."
