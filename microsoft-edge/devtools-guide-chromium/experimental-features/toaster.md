# Streamline your workflows with the Toaster

Toaster is a new Microsoft Edge experiment that makes it possible to type commands to access common browser and developer tools features by typing easier to remember names. Toaster makes it faster for keyboard users to access functionalities that normally require multiple mouse clicks or keyboard shortcuts.
