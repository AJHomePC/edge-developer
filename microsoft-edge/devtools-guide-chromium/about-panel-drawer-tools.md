# About Panel and Drawer tools

Use the **More Tools** (**+**) menu to select any of the Panel tools or Drawer tools.  The **More Tools** menu appears in two places:

*  On the main toolbar at the top of DevTools (where _Panel_ tools usually go).
*  On the **Drawer** toolbar (where _Drawer_ tools usually go).

Any of these tools, whether labelled as a Panel tool or Drawer tool in the **Command Menu**, can be added to either the main toolbar or the Drawer toolbar.

For an overview of Panel tools, Drawer tools, and a few other tools such as the Inspect tool and Device Emulator, see [Microsoft Edge Developer Tools overview](index.md).
