# Share memory traces

The **Memory** tool records runtime data about your web page. Exploring the recorded data makes it possible to improve your web page's memory usage. Additionally, the recorded data can be exported to files on disk. The exported files are called _traces_.

Exporting memory traces is useful when you want to share these files with other people to get help with investigating issues. An exported trace file can be imported in DevTools at any time.

To learn more about how to export and import traces in the **Memory** tool, see [Share performance and memory traces](../evaluate-performance/share-traces.md).
