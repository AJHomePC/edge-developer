# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 104)

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Edge team note for top of What's New](../../includes/edge-whats-new-note.md)]


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Use Layers in 3D View

<!-- Title: Where did Layers go? -->
<!-- Subtitle: Layers isn't a stand-alone tool anymore, it's wrapped up in the comprehensive 3D View; a tool for all your visual debugging needs. -->

The standalone **Layers** tool has now been completely removed.  During the phase-out period, the **Layers** tool remained, as an empty panel containing a link that opened the **3D View** tool.

In the **3D View** tool, the **Composited Layers** view has all the features you love from the **Layers** tool, along with some updates.  The **Composited Layers** view now sits alongside even more visual debugging tools.  Try out the **DOM** and **Z-index** views for debugging while you're in the **3D View** tool, and you'll see how these three views work together.
