# Declare permissions

To use most Edge.* APIs, your extension must declare its intent in the "permissions" field of the manifest. Each permission can be either one of a list of known strings (such as "geolocation") or a match pattern that gives access to one or more hosts. Permissions help to limit damage if your extension is compromised by malware. Some permissions are also displayed to users before installation, as detailed in Permission Warnings.

If an API requires you to declare a permission in the manifest, then its documentation tells you how to do so. For example, the Storage page shows you how to declare the "storage" permission.

Here's an example of the permissions part of a manifest file:

"permissions": [
  "tabs",
  "bookmarks",
  "http://www.blogger.com/",
  "http://*.google.com/",
  "unlimitedStorage"
]

The following table lists the currently available permissions:

| Permission                            | Description                                            
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| "activeTab" | Requests that the extension be granted permissions according to the activeTab specification. |
| "alarms" | Gives your extension access to the chrome.alarms API. |
| "background" | Makes Edge start up early and shut down late, so that extensions can have a longer life. When any installed extension has "background" permission, Edge runs (invisibly) as soon as the user logs into their computerâ€”before the user launches Edge. The "background" permission also makes Edge continue running (even after its last window is closed) until the user explicitly quits Edge. Disabled extensions are treated as if they aren't installed. You typically use the "background" permission with a background page, or a background window. |
