# Sideload an extension


The Microsoft Edge \(Chromium\) browser provides a safe and simple way for you to run as well as debug your extensions while you are developing. This article explains how to load the extension \(also called sideloading\) into the Microsoft Edge \(Chromium\) browser to test it.


To run your extension locally in your browser while developing it \(sideloading\), follow the steps below.

1. Choose the three dots at the top of your browser.

2. Select `Extensions` from the context menu as shown in the following image which will take you to the Extension management page.

   Choose Extensions
:::image-end:::

<!--![Choose Extensions][ImagePart1Threedots]  -->  


3. On Extension management page, enable the **Developer mode** by enabling the toggle at the bottom left of the page as shown in the following image.

:::image type="complex" source="./media/part1-developermode-toggle.png" alt-text="Enable Developer Mode":::
   Enable Developer Mode
:::image-end:::

<!--![Enable Developer Mode][ImagePart1DevelopermodeToggle]  -->  


4. The first time you want to install your Extension, you choose the `Load Unpacked` option as shown in the following image.  This prompts you for a directory where you have your Extension assets file by file.  This installs the Extension as if you had downloaded it from a store.  

:::image type="complex" source="./media/part1-installed-extension.png" alt-text="Installed Extensions":::
   Installed Extensions
:::image-end:::

<!--![Installed Extensions][ImagePart1InstalledExtension]  -->  


5. After you install your Extension, you may update it by selecting the `Reload` button under your Extension listing.  

6. To remove the Extension from your browser, click the `Remove` button on the bottom of the Extension listing.
