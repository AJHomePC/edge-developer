# Extension submission states and overview  

The overview page on the Partner Center displays the state of your extension in the overall submission flow.  

| # |  State |  Details |  
|:--- |:--- |:--- |  
| 1 |  In draft |  You create your submission and save a draft to your account.  You have not submitted your extension package and your submission form details to publish to the Microsoft Store.  Your extension is not available to users in this state.  |  
| 2|  In review |  You have submitted your extension.  Your extension package and your submission form details are reviewed by Microsoft.  Your extension is not available to users in this state.  |  
| 3|  Waiting to publish |  Your submission is in this state after your extension review is complete, and your extension is being prepared for publishing in the Microsoft Store.  This state is an intermediate state between `In review` and `In the store`.  This state may not appear for all submissions.  |  
| 4|  In the store |  The review is now complete, and your extension is published on the Microsoft Store.  Your extension is available on the Microsoft Store in the markets that you specified.  |  
| 5 |  In the store.  Update in review |  Your extension is published on Microsoft Store and you have submitted an update that is under review by Microsoft.  |  
| 6 |  Review failed |  Your submission is in this state if your extension fails a review.  A failed review may occur during the initial review or during an update.  You need to take corrective action and resubmit your extension.  |  
| 7 |  Unavailable in store |  There are three possible scenarios when your extension displays this state:  **Unpublished from store**, **Removed from store**, and **Blocked**.  The description of each of the three states is specified in 8, 9, and 10.  |  
| 8 |  Unpublished from store |  You unpublished your extension from Microsoft Store in Partner Center.  <br />  In Partner Center, on your extension submission page, you choose on **unpublish** button.  <br />  After unpublishing, your extension is no longer available on Microsoft Store for new users to download, but existing users may continue to use their copies of your extension.  |  
| 9 |  Removed from store |  If your extension is found to violate the terms and conditions of Microsoft Store, Microsoft may remove it from Microsoft Store and the state changes to this state.  <br />  After removal of your extension by Microsoft, your extension is no longer available on Microsoft Store for new users to download, but existing users may continue to use their copies of your extension.  |  
| 10 |  Blocked |  If your extension is found to be malicious and compromises security and privacy of users, Microsoft has the right to block your extension from Microsoft Store and the state changes to this state.  <br />  If your extension is blocked, your extension is removed from Microsoft Store, your extension is also removed from user devices.  |
