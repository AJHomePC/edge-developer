# Register as a Microsoft Edge extension developer  

If you're new to Partner Center, this article will help you create a Partner Center account <!-- and register as a Microsoft Edge extension developer --> through which you can submit Microsoft Edge extensions to the [Microsoft Edge Add-ons website](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/Microsoft-Edge-Extensions-Home).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Types of accounts mentioned in this article 

To add and manage users in the Microsoft Edge program to manage extensions, you can now associate your Partner Center account with your organization's Azure Active Directory.

| Type of account | Description |
|---|---|
| _Microsoft account (MSA)_, _MSA account_ | An Outlook, Live, or Hotmail account.  A work or school account is not a Microsoft account (MSA). |
| _Partner Center account_ | An account on partner.microsoft.com.  To submit Microsoft Edge extensions, you need a Partner Center account for which the primary owner is an MSA account. |
| _Microsoft Edge Program account_ | Enables multiple users to work with Microsoft Edge extensions at Partner Center. |
| _Azure Active Directory_, _AD account_, _Azure AD_ | An Azure Active Directory account. |
| _Azure Active Directory tenant_, _AAD tenant_ | __ |


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## How to determine whether you have a Partner Center account and whether its primary owner is an MSA account

<!-- 'tenant' is needed in 2nd article, not 1st article. -->

1. You need a Microsoft account (MSA).  If you don't have an MSA account, create one.  One way to create an MSA account is to use your existing GitHub account to log in to Partner Center - dialog boxes help you automatically create an MSA account.
1. Use that MSA account to login to Partner Center.
1. Register for the Microsoft Edge program, to be able to submit extensions.

<!-- this article has a broader audience than aad-account.md -->

To submit an extension to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store, you must be registered as a developer with the Microsoft Edge program.  The Microsoft Edge program is located on [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter].  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is no registration fee for submitting extensions to the Microsoft Edge program.  


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Before you begin  

If you don't have an account, or if you have an existing _commercial_ account with Partner Center, create a new [Microsoft account (MSA)][WindowsCommunityEverythingAboutMicrosoftAccounts] (or use an existing Microsoft account (MSA)) to register with the Microsoft Edge program.  To create a Microsoft account (such as an Outlook, Live, or Hotmail account):

1. Navigate to [account.microsoft.com][MicrosoftAccount].  
1. Choose **Create a Microsoft account**.
1. Complete the registration steps.
    
If you have a Partner Center account for which the Primary Owner is an MSA account, use that MSA account to sign into your Partner Center account.  Then enroll in the Microsoft Edge program. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Edge extensions does not currently support registering with a work or school account. You need to register using an MSA account and then link your Azure AD tenants with that account for extension management. 


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Enroll in the Microsoft Edge program on Partner Center  

1.  Navigate to the [developer page][MicrosoftPartnerCenter].
1.  Select **Partner Center**.  
1.  If you have an MSA account, sign into it now.  If not, either create a new MSA account directly, or login by using your GitHub credentials.  Use the same MSA account that you use to sign into your Partner Center account (a Partner Center account for which the Primary Owner is an MSA account).  After you sign in, a registration form is displayed. The following table describes the fields on the registration form.  
    1.  Or, sign-in by using your existing GitHub account.  Open the following link in a new tab or window: [Logging in to Partner Center by using your GitHub account](github.md).  Your GitHub account will be linked to a Microsoft account whose credentials you can use to register for the Microsoft Edge program.  Refer to the following table for information about the fields in the registration form.
    
    To enroll in the Microsoft Edge program, sign in to your Partner Center account and complete the form.

          *   **Individual account**  
              An individual account is appropriate for a developer not associated with a company. The account verification process is shorter, and involves verifying that the publisher display name is available.  

          *   **Company account**  
              A company account is associated with an organization or business. The account verification process is longer, and involves confirmation that you are authorized to create the account for your company.  The duration of the process may range from a few days to a few weeks.  Your company may receive phone calls from Microsoft verification partners.
