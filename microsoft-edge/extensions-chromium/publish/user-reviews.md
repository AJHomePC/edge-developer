Microsoft recently launched a new feature enabling you to respond to user reviews received on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons product page.

You can view your extension’s reviews and ratings and engage with user reviews from the Partner Center dashboard.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
Follow these steps to view your extension’s **Reviews** page:

1. Navigate to your Partner Center account and select an extension.

2. From the left panel, click **Extension overview** > **Reviews** to view your extension reviews, or click on the star rating of an extension on the **Overview** page of **Home** > **Edge** breadcrumb trail.
