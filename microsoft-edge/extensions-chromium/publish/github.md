# Publish add-ons by using your GitHub credentials

Many extension developers use GitHub to build and manage their extension code base.  You can use the same GitHub account to login to Microsoft Partner Center and publish your Microsoft Edge add-on to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website. 

If you are a GitHub user, you don't need to create a new Microsoft account and remember additional passwords.  Just use GitHub authentication to sign into Partner center and publish your extensions to the Microsoft Edge add-ons website.

After you have registered in the Microsoft Edge program, you can port your Chrome extensions to create Microsoft Edge extensions.  To help you manage extensions, you can add more users to the Partner Center account by adding an Azure Account directory (AAD) account to your Partner Center account.

To begin submitting extensions by using GitHub, you must register for the Microsoft Edge program in Partner Center by using your GitHub credentials.  You'll need to link to a Microsoft account (an MSA account), as follows.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 1: Go to Partner Center to sign in

Go to [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter].  You'll be taken to the **Sign-in** page, with an option to sign in with your Microsoft account (also called an _MSA account_).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 2: Select "Sign-in options" to view alternative sign in options 

Select **Sign-in options** at the bottom of the page, and then select **Sign in with GitHub**.  Enter your GitHub account credentials you want to use to publish extensions. 

Currently, you can only use your _personal_ GitHub account to login to Partner Center.  You might not be able to use your _work_ account on GitHub to log in, as it is not supported at the moment.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 3: Authorize Microsoft to access your GitHub account

Microsoft requires your permission to access your GitHub account.  Select **Authorize Microsoft-corp**.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 4: GitHub credentials linked with Microsoft account

Microsoft checks whether your GitHub account is already linked to a Microsoft (MSA) account.  If your GitHub account isn't linked to an MSA account, Microsoft will create a new MSA account and link it to your GitHub credentials.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 5: Register for Microsoft Edge Program on Partner Center using the newly linked GitHub account

Your GitHub account will now work as a Microsoft (MSA) account.  You can now use your GitHub credentials to register as a Microsoft Edge extension developer.  You can now publish extensions free of charge.

You can also port your Chrome extensions to become Microsoft Edge extensions by using this GitHub-based sign-in option.  To better manage your Microsoft Edge extensions, you can optionally register your organization for the Microsoft Edge program on Partner Center by associating your Azure Account directory (AAD) account with your MSA account.
