# Manage Account Settings  

You can manage the account settings and profile details of your Microsoft Edge Developer account in the Account setting section of the [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter].  

## Account settings  

To view your account settings, select the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner of [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] and then select **Developer settings**.  In **Developer settings** you will find information about your account, find links to other pages where you can view information, and edit your account information.  

In the **Account details** section, you see the status and type of your account.  You also see your Seller ID and other publisher ID info here.  These values are assigned by Microsoft to uniquely identify your developer account and are read-only.  

## Contact Details  

The **Contact info** section displays the details you provided when setting up your account.  We use this information to contact you about your account.  The publisher display name that is displayed to users in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store is also located here. 
  
Edit this section if your contact information has changed. Select **Update**, or select **Contact info** in the left navigation menu, make your changes, and then select **Save**.  

Changing any of your contact details may require us to verify your account again, especially if you have a company account.  Your verification status returns to `Pending` while the review is in process.  The duration of the verification process ranges from a few days to a couple of weeks, and your company may receive a phone call from our verification partner.  

## Other settings  

Review the following settings in the Account settings section.  

| Account Settings | Description |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Verification status | Review your verification status when your account is going through the verification process. For example, your account is verified when you first sign up for an account, or after you update your contact information. |  
| Programs | Find information about enrolled programs or other programs that may be of interest to you.  
| Agreements | View the agreements that your account has accepted. |
