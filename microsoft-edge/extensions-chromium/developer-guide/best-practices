# Best Practices for extensions

Follow these Best Practices to implement your extension and list it on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons Store.

## Design a high-quality extension

We encourage our developers to build extensions that conform to Microsoftâ€™s standards of security, privacy, transparency, and user experience. 

**Security**: Make sure that your extension does not pose any security threats to users. 

**Privacy**: Make sure that your extension handles user data appropriately. 

**User experience**: Make sure that your extension provides an intuitive and seamless user experience. 

**Store listing**: Make sure that your extension's store listing sets correct user expectations and clearly communicates what the extension does.

## Disclaimer:

We intend to continue learning from our developer experiences and the above best practices will continue getting updated accordingly.
