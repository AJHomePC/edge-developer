# Deployment samples

There's a 1-to-1 correspondence between articles in this documentation and Readme files in the WebView2Samples repo (in almost all cases).  The Readme which corresponds to the present top-level article is [Readme: WebView2 Samples](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples#readme).

For each deployment sample in the WebView2Samples repo, there's an article in the regular docs, as well as a Readme, directory, and solution file in the repo.

| Article | Sample |
|---|---|
| [WebView2 Deployment Visual Studio installer](wv2deploymentvsinstallersample.md) | [WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample) |
| [WiX Burn Bundle to deploy the Runtime](wv2deploymentwixburnbundlesample.md) | [WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample) |
| [WiX Custom Action to deploy the Runtime](wv2deploymentwixcustomactionsample.md) | [WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample) |
