# WebView2 sample: Win32 C++ app with Visual Composition

This WebView2 sample demonstrates creating an application that embeds a WebView2 control within a Win32 native application.

It is built as a Win32 Visual Studio 2019 project and makes use of both C++ and HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the WebView2 environment.

It also uses Windows Runtime Composition APIs (also called the Visual layer) to take avantage of the Windows UI features and create a better look, feel, and functionality in C++ Win32 applications.

See [WebView2 Sample WinComp](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2SampleWinComp#readme).

This sample is part of the `WebView2Samples` repo.  To use this sample, download or clone the `WebView2Samples` repo.  See [Download the WebView2Samples repo](../how-to/machine-setup.md#download-the-webview2samples-repo) in _Set up your Dev environment for WebView2_.
