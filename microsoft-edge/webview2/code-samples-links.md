# WebView2 sample code

The following WebView2 samples are available in the Get Started guides for WebView2 and in the [WebView2 Samples repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Sample code for Get Started guides

The WebView2 "Get started" guides use starter code for Win32, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), WinForms, and WinUI.

| Task | Article | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Create a WebView2 in a Win32 application | [Get started with WebView2 in Win32 apps](./get-started/win32.md) | Starter code at [WebView2 Samples Win32 Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/Win32_GettingStarted) |
| Set up a WebView2 in a WPF application | [Get started with WebView2 in WPF apps](./get-started/wpf.md) | .NET starter code at [WebView2 Samples WPF Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WPF_GettingStarted) |
| Create a WebView2 in a WinForms application | [Get started with WebView2 in WinForms apps](./get-started/winforms.md) | .NET starter code at [WebView2 Samples WinForms Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WinForms_GettingStarted) |
| Set up a WebView2 in a WinUI 3 application | [Get started with WebView2 in WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK)](./get-started/winui.md) | Starter code at [WebView2 Samples WinUI Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WinUI3_GettingStarted) |
| Create a WebView2 in WinUI 2 application | [Get started with WebView2 in WinUI 2 apps guide](./get-started/winui2.md) | Uses the WinUI 2 NuGet package.  Has no sample code. |

## WebView2 sample apps

WebView2 sample apps include solutions for Win32, WPF, WinForms, and WinUI.  The Microsoft Visual Studio solution file [WebView2Samples.sln](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2Samples.sln) gathers the following samples.

When you load `WebView2Samples.sln` into Visual Studio, the following projects appear in Solution Explorer, as folders:

| Type of sample | Sample Project | Notes and source code location |
|---|---|---|
| Win32 C++ | `WebView2APISample` <!-- below, section 1 "Win32 C++ samples" --> | Includes the code in the [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample) folder. |
| Win32 C++ | `WebView2SampleWinComp` <!-- below, section 1 --> | Includes the code in the [WebView2SampleWinComp](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2SampleWinComp) folder. |
| Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) .NET | `WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser` <!-- below, section 2, "Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) .NET samples" --> | Uses code in the [WebView2WpfBrowser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2WpfBrowser) folder. |
| Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) .NET | `WebView2WpfBrowser` <!-- below, section 2 --> | The .NET Windows Forms Sample is in the [WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser) folder. |
| Chrome Developer Protocol (CDP) | `WV2CDPExtensionWPFSample` <!-- not mentioned in this article --> | Demonstrates the usage patterns of the WebView2 CDP extension in WPF.  The source code is in the [WV2CDPExtensionWPFSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WV2CDPExtensionWPFSample) folder.  |
| Deploying the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime | `WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample` <!-- below, section "Deploy the evergreen WebView2 Runtime", 2nd bullet --> | To learn about deploying [Evergreen WebView2 Runtime](concepts/distribution.md) with your applications, use the two `WV2Deployment*` samples.  The Burn Bundle sample, [WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample/README.md), creates a [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and uses [WiX Burn Bundle](https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/bundle/) to chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime. |
| Deploy the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime | `WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample` <!-- below, section "__" --> | The Custom Action sample, [WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample/README.md), creates a [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and uses [WiX Custom Action](https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/wixdev/extensions/authoring_custom_actions.html) to chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime. |

### UWP/WinUI samples

A comprehensive API sample for UWP/WinUI is available from the [WinUI Controls Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview).

### Deploy the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime

This sample is a separate installer sample; it's not part of the `WebView2Samples` repo.

* [WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample/README.md) uses the [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudioclient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects) extension for Visual Studio, to create an installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.
