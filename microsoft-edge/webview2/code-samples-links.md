# WebView2 sample code

This article provides descriptions and links for the WebView2 sample code repository. Samples include content referenced in the WebView2 get started guides.

For the complete repository, navigate to [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Samples \(github.com\)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples).

## Get started guides sample code

The WebView2 get started guides use starter code for Win32, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), WinForms, and WinUI.

* Read [Get started with WebView2 in Win32 apps](./get-started/win32.md) to create a WebView in a Win32 application using the starter code at [WebView2 Samples Win32 Getting Started \(github.com\)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/Win32_GettingStarted)

* See [Get started with WebView2 in WPF apps](./get-started/wpf.md) to set up a WebView in a WPF application using the .NET starter code at [WebView2 Samples WPF Getting Started \(github.com\)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WPF_GettingStarted)

* Use [Get started with WebView2 in WinForms apps](./get-started/winforms.md) to create a WebView in a WinForms application using the .NET starter code at [WebView2 Samples WinForms Getting Started \(github.com\)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WinForms_GettingStarted)

* Read [Get started with WebView2 in WinUI 3 \(Windows App SDK\)](./get-started/winui.md) to set up a WebView in a WinUI 3 application using the starter code at [WebView2 Samples WinUI Getting Started \(github.com\)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WinUI3_GettingStarted)

* There is also a [Get started with WebView2 in WinUI 2 apps \(public preview\)](./get-started/winui2.md) guide that uses the WinUI 2 NuGet package, and has no sample code.

## WebView2 sample apps code

WebView2 sample apps include solutions for Win32, WPF, WinForms, and WinUI.

* The Microsoft Visual Studio solution file [WebView2Samples.sln](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2Samples.sln) is a collection that uses the following samples.

    * The Win32 C++ sample includes the code in the [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample) and [WebView2SampleWinComp](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2SampleWinComp) folders.

    * The .NET Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Sample is in the [WebView2WpfBrowser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2WpfBrowser) folder. The .NET Windows Forms Sample is in the [WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser) folder.

    * UWP / WinUI samples  are available from the [WinUI Controls Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview).

* To learn about deploying [Evergreen WebView2 Runtime](concepts/distribution.md) with your applications, use the following samples.

    * [WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample]() creates a [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and uses [WiX Custom Action](https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/wixdev/extensions/authoring_custom_actions.html) to chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.

    * [WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample]() creates a [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and uses [WiX Burn Bundle](https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/bundle/) to chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.

    * [WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample]() uses the [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudioclient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects) to create an installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.
