# WebView2 sample code

The following WebView2 samples are available in the Get Started guides for WebView2 and in the [WebView2 Samples repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Sample code for Get Started guides

The WebView2 "Get started" guides use starter code for Win32, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), WinForms, and WinUI.

| Platform | Article | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Win32 | [Get started with WebView2 in Win32 apps](./get-started/win32.md) | Starter code at [WebView2 Samples Win32 Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/Win32_GettingStarted) |
| WPF | [Get started with WebView2 in WPF apps](./get-started/wpf.md) | .NET starter code at [WebView2 Samples WPF Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WPF_GettingStarted) |
| WinForms | [Get started with WebView2 in WinForms apps](./get-started/winforms.md) | .NET starter code at [WebView2 Samples WinForms Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WinForms_GettingStarted) |
| WinUI 3 | [Get started with WebView2 in WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK)](./get-started/winui.md) | Starter code at [WebView2 Samples WinUI Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WinUI3_GettingStarted) |
| WinUI 2 | [Get started with WebView2 in WinUI 2 apps guide](./get-started/winui2.md) | Uses the WinUI 2 NuGet package.  Has no sample code. |

## WebView2 sample apps

WebView2 sample apps include solutions for Win32, WPF, WinForms, and WinUI.  The Microsoft Visual Studio solution file [WebView2Samples.sln](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2Samples.sln) gathers the following samples.

These samples are hybrid applications that use the Microsoft Edge WebView2 control.

When you load `WebView2Samples.sln` into Visual Studio, the following projects appear in Solution Explorer, as folders:

| Type of sample | Sample Project | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Win32 C++ | [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample) | Embeds a WebView2 within a Win32 native application.  This sample is built as a Win32 Visual Studio 2019 project.  This sample makes use of both C++ and HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the WebView2 environment.<br/><br/>  This API Sample showcases a selection of WebView2's event handlers and API methods that allow a native Win32 application to directly interact with a WebView and vice versa. |
| Win32 C++ | [WebView2SampleWinComp](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2SampleWinComp) | Embeds a WebView2 within a Win32 native application. It is built as a Win32 Visual Studio 2019 project and makes use of both C++ and HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the WebView2 environment.<br/><br/>  This sample uses Windows Runtime Composition APIs (also called the Visual layer) to take advantage of the latest Windows 10 UI features and create better look, feel, and functionality in C++ Win32 applications. |
| Windows Forms | [WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser) | Embeds a WebView2 within a Windows Forms application.  This sample is built as a Windows Forms Visual Studio 2019 project and makes use of both C# and HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the WebView2 environment. |
| Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) .NET | [WebView2WpfBrowser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2WpfBrowser) | Embeds a WebView2 within a WPF application. It is built as a WPF Visual Studio 2019 project and makes use of both C# and HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the WebView2 environment. |
| Chrome Developer Protocol (CDP) | [WV2CDPExtensionWPFSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WV2CDPExtensionWPFSample) | Demonstrates the usage patterns of the WebView2 CDP extension in WPF.  This sample is built as a WPF Visual Studio 2019 project and makes use of C# in the WebView2 environment.<br/><br/>  This application is built with the [WebView2 CDP Extension](https://aka.ms/webviewcdp) that defines all CDP methods, events, and types.  The `WV2CDPExtensionSample`<!-- insert 'WPF'? --> showcases using Chrome [DevTools Protocol](../devtools-protocol-chromium\index.md) functions using a `DevToolsProtocolHelper` object in WebView2. |
| Deploying the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime | [WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample/README.md) | To learn about deploying the [Evergreen WebView2 Runtime](concepts/distribution.md) with your applications, use the two `WV2Deployment*` samples.<br/><br/> This sample creates a [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and uses [WiX Burn Bundle](https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/bundle/) to chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime. |
| Deploy the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime | [WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample/README.md) | This sample creates a [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and uses [WiX Custom Action](https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/wixdev/extensions/authoring_custom_actions.html) to chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime. |

## UWP/WinUI samples

A comprehensive API sample for UWP/WinUI is available from the [WinUI Controls Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview).

This sample shows all of the XAML controls in an interactive format.  This app is the interactive companion to the [Fluent Design Guidelines](/windows/uwp/design/basics/) and shows the usage of both UWP Xaml APIs and [Windows UI Toolkit](/uwp/toolkits/winui/) APIs.

## Deploy the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime

This sample is a separate installer sample; it's not part of the `WebView2Samples` repo.

* The [WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample/README.md) uses the [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudioclient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects) extension for Visual Studio, to create an installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.
