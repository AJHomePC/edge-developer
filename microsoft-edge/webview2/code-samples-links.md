## Apps in the WebView2Samples.sln file

The `WebView2Samples` repo includes sample projects for Win32, WPF, WinForms, and WinUI.  These samples are hybrid applications that use the Microsoft Edge WebView2 control.

1. In a separate window or tab, see [WebView2Samples repo (README page)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples).

1. Clone the `WebView2Samples` repo, as described in [Clone or download the WebView2 samples repo](#clone-or-download-the-webview2samples-repo) below.

1. In your resulting, local copy of the repo directory structure, find all `*.sln` files.

1. Open one of the `.sln` files.  For example, open your local copy of the solution file [WebView2Samples.sln](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2Samples.sln) in Microsoft Visual Studio.  When you open that solution file in Visual Studio, **Solution Explorer** contains the following WebView2 samples, as projects:

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Deploy the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime

The [WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample/README.md) uses the [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudioclient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects) extension for Visual Studio, to create an installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.

This sample is a separate installer. It's not part of the `WebView2Samples` repo.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Install git, Visual Studio, and a preview channel of Microsoft Edge

The platform-specific Get Started guides contain some platform-specific setup steps to set up your dev environment.  The present section is general-purpose.

To open the WebView2 samples and run them in debug mode, install the following development software.

### Install git

1. If you want to clone the `WebView2Samples` repo, and if git isn't not already installed, [Download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.  git will be used during cloning the `WebView2Samples` repo from GitHub, below.


### Install Visual Studio

1. Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) 2015 or later (such as Visual Studio Professional 2022).

   The WebView2 samples are designed for Microsoft **Visual Studio**, not Microsoft **Visual Studio Code**.

   If you are installing Visual Studio 2022, you can accept the defaults for now; you can click **Install**, and decline installing the Workloads at this time.

   Initial setup of Visual Studio is done.  It's likely that additional Visual Studio setup dialogs will open later in this tutorial.

Platform-specific Get Started guides contain more information about dev machine setup; for example, the Win32 tutorial tells how to install workloads if prompted to, upon opening a partiular sample.  For example, see [Install the "Desktop development with C++" workload](get-started/win32.md#install-the-desktop-development-with-c-workload) in _Get started with WebView2 in Win32 apps_.


### Install a preview channel of Microsoft Edge

1. Install any [Microsoft Edge Insider (preview) Channel](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/download) (Beta, Dev, or Canary) on a supported operating system (OS):
   *  Windows 7
   *  Windows 8.1
   *  Windows 10
   *  Windows 11

   We recommend using the Canary channel.  The minimum required version is 82.0.488.0.


### Install the WebView2 Runtime (optional)

1. Optionally, install the [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2).

   If unsure, skip this step; you can use the Microsoft Edge preview channel from the previous step instead.

   If you want more information about this decision now, in a new window or tab, see [Understand WebView2 SDK versions](../concepts/versioning.md).

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Clone or download the WebView2Samples repo

To clone the repo, you must first install git, per the previous section.  You can download the repo as a `.zip` file instead of cloning the repo.

*  If you clone the repo, you can update your local copy using git commands or features of various Dev apps.

*  If you download the repo as a `.zip` file, you get a snapshot copy of the repo.  You can then download another, updated copy of the repo later.

![Cloning or downloading the WebView2Samples repo.](media/cloning-the-webview2-samples-repo-samples-article.png)


### Learn about the WebView2Samples repo

1. In a new browser window or tab, briefly explore the repo's directory layout online at GitHub: [https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps).

1. Briefly go into the `SampleApps` folder.

1. Briefly go into `GettingStartedGuides`.  For example, go into `Win32_GettingStarted` and notice `WebView2GettingStarted.sln`, and look in `HelloWebView.cpp`.

Then return here and continue with the steps below.


### Downloading the WebView2Samples repo

If you want to download the repo (as a `.zip` file):

1. Open the [WebView2Samples repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples) in a new window or tab.

1. Click the green **Code** button in the upper right of the GitHub repo, and then click **Download ZIP**.

   ![Cloning the WebView2Samples repo.](media/cloning-the-webview2-samples-repo-samples-article.png)

   The **Download** pop-up appears in Microsoft Edge:

   ![The 'Settings and more' icon in the toolbar of Microsoft Edge.](media/settings-and-more-edge-icon.png)

   In Microsoft Edge, if the **Download** pop-up isn't visible, click **Settings and more** (...) and then click **Downloads**.

1. In the **Downloads** pop-up window, hover to the right of `WebView2Samples-master.zip` and then click the **Show in folder** (folder) icon.

   It is recommended that you don't click the **Open file** link, because that immediately unzips the file in your Downloads area, which could make it harder (and slower) to move to your desired location.

1. Copy or cut the `WebView2Samples-master.zip` file from your Downloads directory to a regular directory, such as `Documents`.

1. Unzip the .`WebView2Samples-master.zip` file and note the location of the unzipped files.

   ![The downloaded, unzipped WebView2Samples repo.](media/downloaded-samples-repo-unzipped.png)

1. Study the breakout of main directories.  `-master` is the name of the repo branch that this downloaded directory snapshot represents.


### Obtain the URL for cloning the WebView2Samples repo

If you are cloning instead of downloading the repo:

1. Open the [WebView2Samples repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples) in a new window or tab.

1. Click the green **Code** button in the upper right of the GitHub repo, select **Clone**, and then click the **Copy** icon (or, select the HTTPS URL string in the text box and copy it).

   ![Cloning the WebView2Samples repo.](media/cloning-the-webview2-samples-repo-samples-article.png)

1. Decide which tool you want to use to locally clone the repo:
   *  Visual Studio
   *  GitHub Desktop
   *  Git Bash shell or command prompt


Next, clone the GitHub repo to your local drive.  To do that, follow the appropriate steps below, for the tool you want to use.


### Cloning the repo by using Visual Studio

If you want to use Visual Studio to clone the GitHub repo to your local drive:

1. In Visual Studio, select **File** > **Clone repository**.

1. Enter the URL that you copied from the GitHub repo.

1. From within the same dialog box, or in a file explorer utility, you can create a general-purpose root `git` or `GitHub` folder in a writeable location, then select that directory, so that the repo will be cloned there, as a new directory.

   For example, you could create the repo in the parent folder: `C:\Users\myUserName\Documents\GitHub\`, so that the cloning operation will create the new directory `C:\Users\myUserName\Documents\GitHub\WebView2Samples`.

You've cloned the repo to your local drive.  Skip to the next major section below.


### Cloning the repo by using GitHub Desktop

If you want to use GitHub Desktop to clone the GitHub repo to your local drive:

1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).

1. In GitHub Desktop, select **File** > **Clone repository**.

1. In Visual Studio or GitHub Desktop, enter the URL that you copied from the GitHub repo.

1. From within the same dialog box, or in a file explorer utility, you can create a general-purpose root `git` or `GitHub` folder in a writeable location, then select that directory, so that the repo will be cloned there, as a new directory.

   For example, you could create the repo in the parent folder: `C:\Users\myUserName\Documents\GitHub\`, so that the cloning operation will create the new directory `C:\Users\myUserName\Documents\GitHub\WebView2Samples`.

You've cloned the repo to your local drive.  Skip to the next major section below.


### Cloning the repo by using Git Bash shell or a command prompt

If you instead want to clone the repo by using a Git Bash shell or command prompt:

1. Clone the repo to your local drive, entering the URL string that you copied from the GitHub repo:

   ```Shell
   # example location where the repo directory will be added:
   cd c:/users/myusername/documents/github/
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples.git
   ```

   ![Using the Git Bash shell to enter the git clone command in your desired local target git or GitHub repo directory.](media/git-bash-git-clone-url-command.png)

   The directory is created on your local drive, in the path you specified, such as in the following figure:

   ![File Explorer showing the directory for the cloned WebView2Samples repo.](media/file-explorer-cloned-webview2-samples-repo.png)

   You've cloned the repo to your local drive.

1. In your resulting, local copy of the repo directory structure, find all `*.sln` files.

1. Open a `.sln` file in Visual Studio.  For example, open your local copy of [WebView2Samples.sln](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2Samples.sln).  This repo's solution files require Visual Studio, not Visual Studio Code.
