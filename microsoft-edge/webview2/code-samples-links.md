# WebView2 sample code

This article provides descriptions and links for the [WebView2 Samples repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples). These samples are covered in the WebView2 "Get started" guides.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Get started guides sample code

The WebView2 "Get started" guides use starter code for Win32, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), WinForms, and WinUI.

### Create a WebView in a Win32 application

Read [Get started with WebView2 in Win32 apps](./get-started/win32.md) and use the starter code at [WebView2 Samples Win32 Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/Win32_GettingStarted).

### Set up a WebView in a WPF application

See [Get started with WebView2 in WPF apps](./get-started/wpf.md) to use the .NET starter code at [WebView2 Samples WPF Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WPF_GettingStarted).

### Create a WebView in a WinForms application

Read [Get started with WebView2 in WinForms apps](./get-started/winforms.md) and use the .NET starter code at [WebView2 Samples WinForms Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WinForms_GettingStarted).

### Set up a WebView in a WinUI 3 application

Read [Get started with WebView2 in WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK)](./get-started/winui.md) and use the starter code at [WebView2 Samples WinUI Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WinUI3_GettingStarted).

### Create a WebView2 in WinUI 2 application

See the [Get started with WebView2 in WinUI 2 apps guide](./get-started/winui2.md) that uses the WinUI 2 NuGet package, and has no sample code.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## WebView2 sample apps code

WebView2 sample apps include solutions for Win32, WPF, WinForms, and WinUI.

* The Microsoft Visual Studio solution file [WebView2Samples.sln](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2Samples.sln) is a collection that uses the following samples.

### Win32 C++ samples

Includes the code in [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample) and [WebView2SampleWinComp](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2SampleWinComp) folders.

### Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) .NET samples

Uses code in the [WebView2WpfBrowser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2WpfBrowser) folder. The .NET Windows Forms Sample is in the [WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser) folder.

### UWP / WinUI samples

Are available from the [WinUI Controls Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview).

### Deploy the evergreen WebView2 Runtime

To learn about deploying [Evergreen WebView2 Runtime](concepts/distribution.md) with your applications, use the following samples.

* [WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample/README.md) creates a [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and uses [WiX Custom Action](https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/wixdev/extensions/authoring_custom_actions.html) to chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.

* [WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample/README.md) creates a [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and uses [WiX Burn Bundle](https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/bundle/) to chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.

* [WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample/README.md) uses the [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudioclient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects) to create an installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.
