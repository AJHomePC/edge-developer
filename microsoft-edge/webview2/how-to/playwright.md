# Use Playwright to automate and test in WebView2

Use Playwright to automate and test webpages in a WebView2 control.  For a commit-specific version of that article, see [WebView2](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/80c593e6396cc0d9a41e9cdf594f2b7aa303bed9/docs/src/webview2.md) at GitHub.

For an older version that lacks filenames at top of code listings, see [WebView2](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/docs/src/webview2.md) at GitHub.

For an older, shorter version of that article with fewer example listings, see [WebView2](https://playwright.dev/docs/webview2) in the Playwright docs.
