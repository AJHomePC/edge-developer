# Network tool integration

The **Network** tool allows you to monitor network traffic and change network conditions of your application right inside Visual Studio Code. 

![The Network tool inside the Edge DevTools for Visual Studio Code extension](../microsoft-edge-devtools-extension-images/vscode-extension-network.png)

Use the **Network** tool to:

* Analyze the network traffic and find out why some resources aren't loaded.

* Simulate different network conditions, such as being offline or having a slow connection.

* Disable any caching that might make it hard to debug your application.

* Simulate different user agents to see how your product appears to a search engine bot or a browser that you can't test in.
