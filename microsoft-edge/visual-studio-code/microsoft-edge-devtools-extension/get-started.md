# Get started using the DevTools extension for Visual Studio Code

These Getting Started articles are step-by-step tutorials about opening and closing DevTools and using it to modify CSS and debug JavaScript.  Follow the steps from top to bottom for a general introduction and to ensure that your machine is set up to use DevTools.

Use these tutorials to:

*  Learn how to open and close DevTools by clicking the **Launch Instance** button, to experiment with the demo **Success** webpage.  See [Get started by clicking the Launch Instance button](./get-started-launch-instance.md).

*  Learn how to open and close DevTools by right-clicking an `.html` file for **Demo To Do** in the **Explorer** of Visual Studio Code, without needing to run a web server.  See [Get started by right-clicking an HTML file](./get-started-right-click-html.md).

*  Learn how to open and close DevTools by clicking the **Launch Project** button, to run **Demo To Do** on a localhost web server and store the URL for the webpage in `launch.json`.  See [Get started by clicking the Launch Project button](./get-started-launch-project.md).

For a thorough tour of the basics, use all three tutorials, in order.
